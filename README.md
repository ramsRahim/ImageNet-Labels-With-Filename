ImageNet Labels with Filename
This repository addresses the issue of missing ImageNet labels in the correct serial order along with their corresponding filenames.    

The file `classnames.txt` contains all ImageNet labels arranged sequentially, paired with their original filenames.   
This can be a helpful resource for researchers and developers working with ImageNet datasets and looking for an easy-to-use, ordered reference for labels.
